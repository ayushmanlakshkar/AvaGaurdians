# Avalanche Detection System

## Team Avagaurdian

**Overview:**
Team Avagaurdian has developed an Avalanche Detection and Mitigation System that considers environmental factors such as humidity, temperature, and wind speed. The system provides early detection of avalanche risks and implements mitigation measures to enhance safety in avalanche-prone areas.

**Features:**
- Real-time monitoring of environmental factors.
- Early detection of potential avalanche risks.
- Automatic mitigation measures based on detected environmental conditions.

**Environmental Factors Considered:**
- Humidity
- Temperature
- Wind Speed

**Technologies Used:**
- Python
- Sensors for environmental data
- Machine Learning algorithms for prediction
- [List any other technologies used]

**Getting Started:**
1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/your-username/avalanche-detection.git`
2. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Run the system: `python main.py`

**Configuration:**
Adjust the configuration settings in `config.yml` to customize the system according to your needs.
